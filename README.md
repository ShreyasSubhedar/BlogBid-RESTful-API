# BlogBid-RESTful-API
## BLOGBID:
- The BlogBid is a content management system `(CMS)` designed for maintaining creative blogs and their respected categories. To
use the site more efficently & `add various platform support`, I design a public RESTful API which helps to enhance the scope
of BlogBid!!! Make a pull request to contribute and raise issues to make the API more stronger and light-weight.
- This microservice is mainly used fot performing various `CRUD` operation on BlogBid DB.
